# Technology Stack Recommendation

To build an enterprise-grade Hybrid RAG system, the Java ecosystem is highly recommended due to its robust OOP principles, multithreading capabilities, and strong presence in enterprise environments.

## Core Technologies

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend Framework** | Java (Spring Boot) | Industry standard for building robust, scalable enterprise microservices and REST APIs. |
| **AI Orchestration** | Spring AI | The best AI framework for Spring Boot. Perfectly designed on OOP principles, providing seamless integrations with LLMs, Vector Stores, and document loaders. |
| **Vector Database** | ChromaDB | Lightweight, open-source vector database. Easy to run via Docker containers and integrates well with Spring AI. |
| **Keyword Database** | Apache Lucene | The underlying engine for Elasticsearch. Perfect for implementing BM25 sparse search locally in Java without needing a full ES cluster. |
| **Large Language Model (LLM)** | Google AI SDK (Gemini API) | State-of-the-art model for both generating high-quality Embeddings (`text-embedding-004`) and Text Generation. |
| **Reranker Model** | Cohere Rerank / HuggingFace | Required for cross-encoder reranking to accurately sort the combined results from ChromaDB and Lucene. |

## Why Java over Python for this project?

While Python is very popular for rapid AI prototyping, building this system in **Java (Spring Boot)** offers several advantages, especially for enterprise resumes:

1. **Enterprise Relevance:** Most large-scale enterprise backend systems are written in Java. Integrating AI directly into existing Java monoliths or microservices is highly valuable.
2. **Concurrency:** Spring Boot handles parallel processing (which we need for Hybrid Retrieval) extremely efficiently.
3. **Architecture:** Spring AI enforces strict interface-based design, making the code much more maintainable and testable compared to Python scripts.
